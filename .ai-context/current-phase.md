# Current Phase: Repository Refactoring & Setup

## Phase 1 Status: COMPLETED ✅
**Start Date**: December 2024
**Completion Date**: December 2024

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Establishing Git/version control procedures
- ✅ Organizing documentation structure (public vs internal)
- ✅ Setting up Docusaurus documentation site
- ✅ Cleaning up and consolidating documentation
- ✅ Fixing broken links and build issues
- ✅ Setting up modern monorepo structure with workspaces
- ✅ TypeScript configuration with strict settings
- ✅ Docker development environment
- ✅ Basic GraphQL schema and resolvers
- ✅ Shared package with types, schemas, and utilities
- ✅ API package with service layer architecture
- ✅ Data pipeline package with scraper foundation

## Current Focus
**Phase 2: Core API Implementation**
- Prisma setup and database schema
- GraphQL resolvers implementation
- Authentication and security middleware
- Testing infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. Set up Prisma with PostgreSQL schema
2. Implement database migrations
3. Create seed data for development
4. Implement GraphQL resolvers with database integration
5. Add authentication middleware
6. Set up comprehensive testing suite

## Key Decisions Made
- Using Git Flow branching strategy
- Conventional Commits for commit messages
- Semantic versioning for releases
- ADR documentation for architectural decisions
- Monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- TypeScript with strict configuration
- GraphQL with Apollo Server
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Docker for development environment
